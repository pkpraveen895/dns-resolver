Part B Implementation

1) I am first trying to validate root server by retrieving the key and cross checking it across the root key digests 

2) I am also creating DS record using SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms from dns key response wherever required.

3) After validation at each state, I am storing the current DS record for validation in the next state


Looks like there are some vacancies to fill in the implementation, my code is not working properly.
